## **📌 Project Workflow**

### **🔹 Step 1: Data Collection (Web Scraping & API Extraction)**

- **Extracted Yelp business data** using the **Yelp Fusion API**.
- Gathered **multiple business categories** (restaurants, gyms, salons, hotels, etc.).
- Retrieved details including **ratings, reviews, price levels, and locations**.
- Saved extracted data into **a structured CSV file** for further processing.

### **🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python & Pandas)**

- Handled **missing values** (e.g., replaced null phone numbers with "Not Provided").
- Converted **data types** (e.g., price levels to numerical, review counts to integers).
- Standardized **address formats and category classifications**.
- Removed **duplicate businesses and inconsistencies** in dataset.
- Saved **cleaned data into \*\*\*\***``.

### **🔹 Step 3: Database Storage (MySQL Integration)**

- Designed an **optimized MySQL schema** for Yelp business data.
- Established **a secure connection** to MySQL using **SQLAlchemy & PyMySQL**.
- Inserted cleaned data into the **MySQL database (**``** and **``** table)**.
- Validated successful data insertion using **SQL queries** in MySQL Workbench.

### **🔹 Step 4: Advanced SQL Queries for Business Insights**

To uncover deep insights, we implemented **complex SQL queries**:

1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) per business type** (Marketing Spend / New Customers)
2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation**
3. **Average Order Value (AOV) by industry**
4. **Revenue contribution per state**
5. **Month-over-month revenue growth trends**
6. **Churn rate analysis (identifying failing businesses)**
7. **State-wise high-rated businesses**
8. **Most consistent businesses (low rating variance)**
9. **Stored Procedures to fetch top businesses dynamically**
10. **Trending businesses based on review growth rate**

### **🔹 Step 5: Power BI Dashboard - Advanced Data Visualization**

- **Connected Power BI to MySQL** to fetch real-time business data.
- Created **calculated measures in DAX**:
  - 📈 **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
  - 💰 **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
  - 📊 **Revenue Share Per State**
  - 📉 **Rolling Revenue & Review Trends**
  - ⭐ **Price vs. Rating Correlation**
- **Designed interactive visualizations**:
  - **Geospatial Analysis:** Filled maps & bubble maps for state-wise insights
  - **Industry Performance:** Bar & scatter plots for category-based trends
  - **Time-Series Analysis:** Line charts for revenue & review trends
  - **Dynamic Filters:** Slicers for state, category, business type, and price level
- **Published dashboard** to **Power BI Service** for scheduled refreshes & sharing.
